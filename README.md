java-game-1
===========

Here is where the project documentation, source code, and image files are kept.
The Source branch holds all of the source code. The Image branch holds all of the images of the levels in the game.
These two branches are in the Master branch, whic is where the user stories, project estimation, and class diagrams 
are kept. There is the entire project in the master branch in the folder "Phdyer D389W352" that can be loaded into Eclipse and ran.

This project is built using preexisting third party libraries made for the Java language.
These libraries:

lwjgl: Lightweight Java Gaming Library
--------------------------------------
This library has multiple classes that enable programmers to build lightweight games through Java.
Using the tools in this library allow other classes to import certain mechanics that are found in
popular Java games released today.

Slick2D
-------
This library is a wrapper for the lwjgl library that is utilized to create state based games.
With this library users are able to create and display images and animations as well as code
collision detection with objects in the game, trigger certain events when conditions are met to
simulate interactivity with the objects in the game.

---------------------------------
The source code for all classes is available in the source code branch of the project.

This project is coded using the Eclipse Indigo IDE with the JRE System Library JavaSE-1.6.

The images and animations seen during the execution of the game were supplied through third party
sources including:

Freebuttons.com

Lostgarden.com
